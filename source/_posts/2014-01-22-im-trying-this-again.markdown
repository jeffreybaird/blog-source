My chicken recipe has improved greatly in the last few months so I thought I would  share it.

# Whole Baked Chicken

If you are anything like me, you grew up thinking that cooking an entire chicken was as intense cooking a Turkey on Thanksgiving. No need to fear! I am going to show you that cooking a whole chicken can be one of the easiest dishes you make and your coworkers will all be jealous of the succulent chicken you bring in for lunch the next day.

## Tools

The key to making this dish easy is having the correct tools. Don't worry, none of them are too expensive and I use most of them for almost every dish I make, so you'll get a lot of mileage out of them.

1. For this recipe we will again bust out ol' faithful, the 12-inch, well-seasoned [cast-iron](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G2XGC88/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00G2XGC88&linkCode=as2&tag=debautblo-20) skillet.

2. A pair of good kitchen shears [Kitchen Shears](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007IR2ME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0007IR2ME&linkCode=as2&tag=debautblo-20)

3. A good meat thermometer. I use this one [Meat Thermometer](http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/all-clad-instant-read-digital-thermometer/?pkey=e%7Call-clad%2Binstant%2Bread%2Bdigital%2Bthermometer%7C7%7Cbest%7C0%7Cviewall%7C24%7C%7C1&cm_src=PRODUCTSEARCH||NoFacet-_-NoFacet-_-search%20term%20-%20fry%20pan%20test-_-) and have been moderately happy with it. However, this one comes highly recommended [Mavericks](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005SWNZWA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005SWNZWA&linkCode=as2&tag=debautblo-20)
