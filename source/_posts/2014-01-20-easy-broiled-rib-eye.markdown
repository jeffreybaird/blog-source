Sometimes, after a long day of work, the last thing Clare and I want to do is spend an hour crafting the perfect Paleo dinner. This steak and salad combination is a great way to have dinner ready in less than 20 minutes and have it feel like a gourmet meal.

# Broiled Rib-Eye

## Tools

1. A 12-inch, well-seasoned cast-iron pan. I use this one from [Lodge.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G2XGC88/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00G2XGC88&linkCode=as2&tag=debautblo-20)

2. A [meat thermometer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005SWNZWA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005SWNZWA&linkCode=as2&tag=debautblo-20)

3. Pepper Grinder/Mortar & Pestle

</div>

* 1/2 tablespoon sea salt
* Olive Oil

## Prep

1. I like to leave the steak on the counter for about 30 minutes prior to cooking. It seems that this allows the steak to cook more evenly

## Cooking

* Turn on the Broiler. When it is warm put the skillet on the top rack and let it heat up for about 5 - 7 minutes. It may start to smoke, open a window and turn on a fan.


* While the skillet is heating up salt and pepper the steak, gently pressing it into the meat. Then, drizzle the steaks with olive oil. Flip the steaks over and repeat.

* Pull the skillet out of the broiler (it will be extraordinarily hot; use a thick pot holder) and put the steaks on it.

* Return the skillet to the top rack of the broiler and set the timer for 4-5 mins.

* Check the steak. If it is at 125 degrees it is ready (rare, the only way it should be eaten).

* Let the steak sit for about 3 to 4 minutes before cutting it.

* Eat!

Clare prepared a spinach salad ahead of time so maybe I'll be able to get her on here to write about that. Enjoy!
