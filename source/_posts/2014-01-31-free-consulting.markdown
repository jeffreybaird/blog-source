I've struggled for a while to figure out where I fit into the activist community.  I have learned lately that I (another cis white hetero male programmer) don't have much, in the way of experiences, to add to the greater conversation.

But I recently helped a writer/activist with some programming tasks, and I realized there might be a lot of activists for whom the Web is complicated territory.  So, if you're an independent activist who works to fight injustice, and you need help on anything Web-related, I'm happy to provide it, free of charge.

I have no idea how many requests I'll get so if it becomes too much to handle I'll have to put some sort of limit on it, but for now let's just see where this goes.
