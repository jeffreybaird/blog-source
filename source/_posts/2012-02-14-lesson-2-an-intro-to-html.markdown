Third post in and I’ve already made an executive decision about this blog, it is about me. I know this may sound a bit selfish. I am okay with that.

I want you to read, follow along and learn with me. I will answer all questions as best I can. I won’t, however, choose what I teach based on popular demand. I want to learn, so I won’t cover things I already know.

So, on that note, we are not going to go over WordPress today like I had originally planned. We are going to go straight into HTML.

Now I know a little HTML but I figure it can’t hurt to get a little refresher so I will start from the beginning.

HTML:
-----

I got my book in the mail, [Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML]("http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfhtml/"). It looks pretty basic and seems like a lot of fun (Lots of pictures). I will try to explain everything as best I can but I will always refer back to the book. If you want to follow along I would suggest purchasing it.

So let us first delve into the basics of HyperText Markup Language or HTML for short. To do that we need to first take a look at where it fits into the equation of the internet.

HTML is the language your browser understands. When you make a website you load HTML file(s) onto a web server. A web server is just a computer that stays on, connected to the internet.

When you visit a website you are sending a request to the server to send you that HTML file. Your browser than interprets all the HTML tags (certain words surrounded by <…>), and displays websites as you know them.

<img csrc = "images/circleofweb.jpg" alt="" width="465" height="603">

 

<br>So now we know where HTML fits into the web in general. It is a language that browsers use to determine the structure of a website. Next lesson, basic HTML tags.

See you next time :)
