Man, it has been a long time since I've written a blog post. The last time you heard from me I had just started working for [Medivo](http://www.medivo.com). My experience at Medivo has been amazing. I learned from some amazing developers, worked on a product I care deeply about and made some great friends.

But all good things come to an end, and as of this Monday I started as a Teacher's Assistant at The Flatiron School. Look at the title of this blog -- teaching has long been a passion of mine. I am pumped to take on this new challenge in my life.

In other news, I've been playing a lot with [Go](http://golang.org). You should go over there and check it out. I will be writing on it soon :-)
