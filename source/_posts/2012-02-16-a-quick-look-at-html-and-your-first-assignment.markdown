Hello!

Today we are going to look at a little basic HTML. I’m running behind so this will be a short post.

This is what a (super) basic HTML file looks like:

 

<pre><code>
  `<html>
    <head> This is the Header </head>
    <body>
      <p> This is a paragraph in the body of the html</p>
    </body>
  </html>`
</pre></code>
