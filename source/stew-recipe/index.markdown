#### Sprinkle on all of the spices

#### Pour the entire quart of broth into the slow cooker (try to cover as many veggies as possible)

#### Give everything a quick mix

#### Set the slow cooker to 'Low' for at least 10 hours. I have set it for as long as 16 hours, the longer it cooks the more tender the meat is.
